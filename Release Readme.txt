This app publishes the feed captured with a FLIR (Point Grey) camera via Spout. Tested with the Blackfly S BFLY-PGE-31S4C camera.

Before running the exe, download and install the 64 bit Spinnaker SDK from FLIR/Point Grey: https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads (requires creating an account)
	- Make sure to choose to install the full SDK (don't choose Camera Evaluation)
	- For Visual Studio Version, choose Visual Studio 2015 instead of 2013
